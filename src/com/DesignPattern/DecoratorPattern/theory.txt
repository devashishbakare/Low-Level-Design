 - why decoration word is being used?

yes, we are decorating the class, not by use, by the choices of the customers.

what kind of choices?

lets, take the example,
-you went to burgerhouse, yesss.
-then you order the tandoori burger(which is my favorite)
-now accounter asked some question before making final bill.
question like?
-want to add extra cheeeeese??
-watn to add extra meyoneees??

then you are answer those question and then final bill will be generated, yes....

Hence you decorated the you burger, according to your choices.


- How is related to our Decorated pattern? and why we use like as pattern to this.
 to answer that, we need to understand some example,
 suppose you are designing a system that has to deal with the choices, you tend to think in observer pattern, it will save hell lot of time

 Example like :
 1) Hotel management system -base price is fixed, and final bill will come up with service that we opted.
 2) Any kind of ordering system. - pizza shop.

 See example to understand better : )
