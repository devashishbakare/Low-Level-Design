Let's consider a scenario
-Suppose we are building a cricket app called (clickbuzz) that notifies viewers about the information such as current cricket's score.
-score like, run rate etc.
-Suppose we want to display CurrentScoreDisplay and AverageScoreDisplay.
-CricketData(Live score tracker) has all the data (runs, bowls etc.) and whenever data changes we should display updated result.

simple words for understanding :

-so we have one subject(live score tracker)
-that notify to those who want their score.
-we will tell someone to, go and tell them and this is the current score now.
-so one can go and update the result in clickbuzz app.


implementation-

subject-(live score tracker)- Has its class
-subject will tell, to one person, who will be person?
-A interface called observer.
-then he will tell clickbuzz that this is updated score
-so now we want to display the average score and current score so, we created classes from them as well.
