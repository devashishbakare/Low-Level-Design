Data abtraction

- It is nothing but essential details are displayed to the user and non-essential units are not displayed to the user.
- Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.
- Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details.
- ex - A man driving a car and he don't know the internal machanism of car.

In java,
Abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes. We can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces.


Abstract classes and Abstract methods

    - An abstract class is a class that is declared with an abstract keyword.
      Eg : abstract class Shape{}

    - An abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation.
      Eg :  public abstract void animalSound();

    - A method-defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass, thus making overriding compulsory

    - An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods(Noramal method)

    - we cannot create a abstract method normal class, in order to use we have to declared that class as abstract

    - abstract class don't have the object so, new keyword word has no use

    - and yes constructor is allowed in abstract classes

When to use abstract classes?

If there is situation where you have fixed base so we make them a abstract and we know other subclass has to implement the abstract methods
depending on there need

Ex : you have shape class you need to return the area give shape let say you have circle and Rectangle, so you make shape class as abstract
     and we create two subclass circle and rectanlge and we computer the area of shape according to the need.
