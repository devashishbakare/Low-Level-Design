what's double checking?

Before directly jumping toward that, lets understand some concepts.

Multithreading-
In simple word, one recourse can be access by multiple tread, at same time, called as the multithreading.

We want to create only one object then in singleton pattern, so there might be possible.
client/anyone want's to access object using the multi-threading concepts.
then multi-threads, will try to create the object, so our code will fail to do that.

How to use multi-threading in code? I don't know about that?
okay, so let's understand another concept then.

Basically this is interface which allows us to execute tasks on threads asynchronously.
Asynchronously- nothing but multiple thing at one time. thread will not wait to anther thread to complete its task.
It also provides the facility to queue up tasks until there is a free thread available. keep going....

why don't we make this our method is synchronised then?
yes, we can.
but we want to stop making the thread to create multiple object, right, so making method synchronised, does make sense.
so, we will create synchronised block, so that we can stop multithreading on object creating only.
