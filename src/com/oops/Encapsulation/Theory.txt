key points
    - Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
    - It is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
    - data can be accessed only through any member function of its own class.
    - we hide data from other class by making members or methods to private.
    - Encapsulation can be achieved by Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.

Advantages of Encapsulation
1) Data Hiding -
     - It will not be visible to the user how the class is storing values in the variables.
     - The user will only know that we are passing the values to a setter method and variables are getting initialized with that value.

2) Flexibility -
    - We can make the variables of the class read-only or write-only depending on our requirement.
    - for read only : delete/omit the setters
    - for write only : delete/omit the getters

3) Reusability and testing code is easy
